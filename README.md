<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>Me and a friend started something we called March madness!
A month where we were gonna be accountability partners, and ensure that we would hit the goals we had set for our self. We used a shared notion template, but quickly found that to be demotivating and to little engaging.
I therefore decided to solve this problem by trying to create the improvement tracker for us.
