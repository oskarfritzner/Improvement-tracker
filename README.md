<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>Me and a friend started something we called March madness!
A month where we were gonna be accountability partners, and ensure that we would hit the goals we had set for our self. We used a shared notion template, but quickly found that to be demotivating and to little engaging.
I therefore decided to solve this problem by trying to create the improvement tracker for us. 
</p>

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* BOOTSTRAP
* JAVASCRIPT

## PROGRESS
<!--Learning-->
<p>
It was the first project that i spent weeks to create, which meant i learned a lot about project management, taking notes on the progress and what i had to do the next time i was to code on it. 
I learned a little about bootstrap.
I learned a lot about working with dates, and how to export to pdf using a library.
